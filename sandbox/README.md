# Welcome to the Pando sandbox!

The purpose of this workspace is to provide live examples of Pando components and patterns.

## Getting Started

To run the sandbox from the `sandbox` directory:

`pnpm run dev`

To run the sandbox from the `root` Pando directory:

`pnpm run start:sandbox`

This project will run by default on http://localhost:3000

## Directory structure

You can all Pando `panda-preset` and `react` package examples within the `/app/react` directory. The `/app/components` directory is for shared components that are not related to Pando code examples.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
