# This file should only export the dark theme colors. Other themes
# will be declared in our normalize.css file. This is to keep performance
# high and prevent "token vomit" (i.e. we just need to overwrite tokens
# for each theme - not create additional unique ones).

ps:
  background:
    value: '{color.base.blue.50.dark.value}'
  text:
    value: '{color.base.white.value}'
