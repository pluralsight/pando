This is a first to Pluralsight but is commonly used all over Github.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_G6Or" id="for"><a href="https://design.pluralsight.com/docs/reference/components/for" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">For</a><a href="#for" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to for" title="Direct link to for">​</a></h4><p>For...when you need to iterate over some data, we have the <a href="https://design.pluralsight.com/docs/reference/components/for" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">For</a> component which is another Solid-JS inspired API that helps you render a list in a declarative (code base) and performant (customer experience) way.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_G6Or" id="tabs"><a href="https://design.pluralsight.com/docs/reference/components/tabs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tabs</a><a href="#tabs" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to tabs" title="Direct link to tabs">​</a></h4><p>Last, we have the <a href="https://design.pluralsight.com/docs/reference/components/tabs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tabs</a> family which is a set of components that help you build a tabbed interface. Fun fact, it also handles <a href="https://design.pluralsight.com/docs/reference/components/tabs/#dynamic-tabs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">heavy data loading</a> for you!</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_G6Or" id="developer-experience">Developer Experience<a href="#developer-experience" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Developer Experience" title="Direct link to Developer Experience">​</a></h3><p>The new APIs also ship JSDOC comments to help you understand how to use the components right where you are in your IDE.</p><p>We have also updated the build process so you can import types from the library directly.

The only thing we are missing is a few more components mentioned in our <a href="https://github.com/pluralsight/pando/discussions/1312" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Library Status Discussion</a>. We are closer than ever!</p><p>But that's not all for React! We have a few more things to announce...</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_G6Or" id="react-aria">React-aria<a href="#react-aria" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to React-aria" title="Direct link to React-aria">​</a></h2><p>We have officially launched our <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pluralsight/react-aria" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">React-aria</a> library which is a set of <strong>high performant</strong> React hooks that help you build accessible components. This is used internally in the React library so there is no need to install it when using Pando.</p><p>As Pando has matured we have realized that we need to start separating our a11y and styles libraries. This is the first step in that direction.</p><p>The new APIs also ship JSDOC comments to help you understand how to use the components right where you are in your IDE.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_G6Or" id="headless-styles">Headless-styles<a href="#headless-styles" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Headless-styles" title="Direct link to Headless-styles">​</a></h2><p>With the introduction of React-aria, we can now update our <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pluralsight/headless-styles" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Headless-styles</a> library to own only styling which will help the library scale long-term. We have started this migration with the <a href="#react">new components</a> mentioned above.</p><p>The new APIs also ship JSDOC comments to help you understand how to use the components right where you are in your IDE.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_G6Or" id="whats-next">What's Next?<a href="#whats-next" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What's Next?" title="Direct link to What's Next?">​</a></h2><p>We have very <strong>BIG</strong> changes in store for our future. This means that we will probably ship one more minor release that contains the final components for the React lib, then we will be moving to the official v1 release.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_G6Or" id="v1-release">v1 Release<a href="#v1-release" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to v1 Release" title="Direct link to v1 Release">​</a></h3><p>We are planning on releasing v1 in the next few months and will bring a new developer experience that is the best Pando (or Pluralsight) has ever seen. Here is the high level details of what you can expect:</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_G6Or" id="pando-cli">Pando CLI<a href="#pando-cli" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Pando CLI" title="Direct link to Pando CLI">​</a></h4><p>In v1, we will be introducing a new CLI that will help streamline using Pando. This will help you setup and maintain anything Pando related in your app through automation. ✊</p><p>Example of a future command:</p><div class="language-bash codeBlockContainer_iMVN theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#403f53;--prism-background-color:#FBFBFB"><div class="codeBlockContent_NuJh"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-bash codeBlock_iAW6 thin-scrollbar"><code class="codeBlockLines__hnX"><span class="token-line" style="color:#403f53"><span class="token plain">npx pando setup --typescript</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup_ZwwQ"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_YS9w" aria-hidden="true"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonIcon_Km1z"><path fill="currentColor" d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_j9D4"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div><p>This command would setup your app with all the necessary configs and dependencies to use Pando with Typescript. Likewise, we will have a command that will help you migrate from version to version. 🎉</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_G6Or" id="panda-css-">Panda CSS 🐼<a href="#panda-css-" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Panda CSS 🐼" title="Direct link to Panda CSS 🐼">​</a></h4><p>In v1, Headless styles will migrate to <a href="https://panda-css.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Panda CSS</a> which will help create consistency across all of our teams regarding styling libraries. This means that each user of Pando should <em>only</em> use Panda CSS for styling. Panda does what Headless-styles was meant to do long-term and is very easy and scalable to use. Likewise, it natively supports close to any JSX-like syntax (including Svelte) which means that if and when we need to switch technologies - teams can still use Pando without worry.</p><p>The CLI above will install and setup a panda.config.ts file for you to use in your app. This will allow your team to have a solid styling foundation that is both easy to use and scale whenever your team needs to deviate from Pando.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_G6Or" id="github-actions">Github Actions<a href="#github-actions" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Github Actions" title="Direct link to Github Actions">​</a></h4><p>We will also be introducing a Github Actions workflow to help quality check our code-bases to ensure everyone is on the latest version of Pando and only using Panda-CSS. 🚀</p><p>One of our biggest goals with Pando is to help provide a stable structure for the styling FE tech stack at Pluralsight. This is very big problem with the current product that is loading anywhere from up to 5 different styling libraries at once. 🙅‍♀️</p><p>This will help us ensure that we are delivering as high performant of a product for our customers as possible, while also making it easy for our teams to build new features and context switch successfully if there is ever a need for teammates to move around.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_G6Or" id="future-ideas">Future Ideas<a href="#future-ideas" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Future Ideas" title="Direct link to Future Ideas">​</a></h2><p>Interested in where we are going or have a new idea of your own?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today marks a big milestone for the design system as we happily introduce the Pando React library and discuss our future! 🎉</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_G6Or" id="docs">Docs<a href="#docs" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Docs" title="Direct link to Docs">​</a></h2><p>We have a pretty big update to share regarding our docs! We do our best to constantly test and research current standards to make sure we are always presenting the best solution that matches our <a href="https://design.pluralsight.com/docs/learn/about-pando/versioning" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">team standards</a> and have come to realize that we have outgrown our current tech <a href="https://docusaurus.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Docusaurus</a>.</p><p>There are quite a few pros with DS, but the cons for us now outweigh them and in the future, we will be migrating to a more scalable solution via <a href="https://docs.astro.build/en/getting-started/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Astro</a>. 🚀</p><p>For now, we have a couple of changes:</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_G6Or" id="single-version-docs">Single Version Docs<a href="#single-version-docs" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Single Version Docs" title="Direct link to Single Version Docs">​</a></h3><p>From this point forth, to prepare for v1 and match our <a href="https://design.pluralsight.com/docs/learn/about-pando/versioning" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">version policy</a>, we will be using a single version docs with <a href="https://design.pluralsight.com/docs/reference/components/badge" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Badges</a> to signify "next" APIs and <a href="https://design.pluralsight.com/docs/reference/components/admonition" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Admonitions</a> for deprecation notices and other information.</p><p>We have all the APIs in a good place for v1 and only plan on introducing one more breaking change via Theme tokens, which we will talk about in the later section of this blog.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_G6Or" id="all-react">All React<a href="#all-react" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to All React" title="Direct link to All React">​</a></h3><p>From this point forth, all the docs will reference the React component library due to the time and effort we spent building it. Our original goal for Pando was to be platform agnostic, however the reality of Pluralsight and our teams are that we are devoted to React. So until that changes, we will keep it simple and just promote the easiest solution for developers to use (which is highly customizable, accessible, and performant).</p><p>Now, let's talk about that new React library!</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_G6Or" id="react">React<a href="#react" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to React" title="Direct link to React">​</a></h2><p>We now offer a composable naturally customzible library that helps developers become better React engineers. This is something that most your common UI libraries have missed over the years (for some reason) and we are choosing to fill the gap.</p><p>What does that mean, though?</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_G6Or" id="react-element-apis">React Element APIs<a href="#react-element-apis" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to React Element APIs" title="Direct link to React Element APIs">​</a></h3><p>All of our components outside of a few "complex ones" extend native React JSX elements. This means, instead of having to learn which properties are exposed or "allowed" - if React allows it for X JSX.Element, so does our API.</p><p>This also means that instead of needing to learn what to expect from Pando, you can just reference the Source of Truth - React.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_G6Or" id="full-customization">Full customization<a href="#full-customization" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Full customization" title="Direct link to Full customization">​</a></h3><p>The same can be said about customizing. Out of the box, there are <em>at least</em> 4 different ways to customize components:</p><ol><li>Unused class names at every level</li><li>The <code>className</code> prop</li><li>The <code>style</code> prop</li><li>Headless-styles library (honestly should never be needed)</li></ol><p>No need for learning new properties or intensive customization logic - just use the styling design you are already using in your project and use React how it was meant to be used. 😉</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_G6Or" id="browser-related-components">Browser related components<a href="#browser-related-components" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Browser related components" title="Direct link to Browser related components">​</a></h3><p>Our composable design builds off the browser APIs which takes helping to learn and use the Pando React library that much easier.</p><p>You can see an example of how we have specific <a href="https://design.pluralsight.com/docs/reference/components/confirm-dialog" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Confirm</a> and <a href="https://design.pluralsight.com/docs/reference/components/prompt-dialog" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prompt</a> Dialogs that matches the Javascript API but enhances it with Promises.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_G6Or" id="react-future-features">React future features?<a href="#react-future-features" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to React future features?" title="Direct link to React future features?">​</a></h3><p>We are about 95% done with the React library, but there are still a few components we are getting ready to build and ship within the next few weeks that you can <a href="https://github.com/pluralsight/pando/discussions/1312" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">check out in our discussion</a>.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_G6Or" id="whats-next">What's Next?<a href="#whats-next" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What's Next?" title="Direct link to What's Next?">​</a></h2><p>From this point until v1 it's all about the <strong>stabilizing</strong> and <strong>we need your help!</strong></p><p>In order for us to make sure our system is ready for mass integration, we need more early adopters to test out migrating in their apps.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today marks a big milestone for the design system as we happily introduce the RC version and our official name, <strong>Pando</strong>! 🎉</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_G6Or" id="welcome-to-pando">Welcome to Pando<a href="#welcome-to-pando" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Welcome to Pando" title="Direct link to Welcome to Pando">​</a></h2><p>That's right! We are proud to introduce the world to the official Pluralsight Design System suite name - <strong>Pando</strong>. You may recognize this name from the latest Disney animated movie (awesome timing) <a href="https://movies.disney.com/strange-world" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Strange World</a> which ties the name for its main plot (no spoilies).</p><p>For those that don't Disney, let's break down what led us to the name Pando.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_G6Or" id="whats-the-why-of-our-system">What's the why of our system?<a href="#whats-the-why-of-our-system" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What's the why of our system?" title="Direct link to What's the why of our system?">​</a></h3><p>The core vision of our team is different from the average Design System team in the industry. Our goals are <strong>not</strong> to just build another system that ultimately leads to the same problems every company faces - flexibility. Ironically, even though our industry is aware of this problem - we keep building the same thing over and over again with only minor tweaks (see any Design System or UI library that exists).</p><p>Because of this, our team is choosing to approach our Design System from a different perspective of building a system with the standard rules (a framework that produces a direct result of our brand visually), but that allows flexibility <em>beyond</em> the basic need in a way that scales with the company and time (i.e., technology is not static, the moment we build for a single library or concept, like Components, is the moment we have failed).</p><p>So what <strong>is</strong> the core vision of our team? To put it plainly, our team's vision is to build an <strong>ecosystem</strong> that allows both designers and developers to use an agnostic pattern that will yield the same standard results, but in a way that is more flexible and scalable than Components.</p><blockquote><p>The foundational roots to a better design system using Pluralsight Design.</p></blockquote><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_G6Or" id="whats-the-why-of-pando">What's the why of Pando?<a href="#whats-the-why-of-pando" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What's the why of Pando?" title="Direct link to What's the why of Pando?">​</a></h3><p>Having a better understanding of what our long-term vision is now, let's connect the dots of the actual meaning of the word "Pando".</p><blockquote><p>"I spread" - An aspen tree located in Utah that originated from a single seed and spreads by sending up new shoots from the expanding root system."</p></blockquote><p><a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/fishlake/home/?cid=STELPRDB5393641#:~:text=When%20the%20Pando%20clone%20was,from%20the%20expanding%20root%20system." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Check out the USDA Forest Service Definition</a></p><p>Just as the Pando starts from a single seed and develops an interconnected root system to grow and multiply, our long-term vision is to build a tool that helps our company (and others) to evolve in the same way:</p><ol><li>Minimal to 0 work for teams regarding branding updates (huge)</li><li>A flexible lego type system for designers to creatively produce the results they need</li><li>A developer experience that is easier than using components</li></ol><p>Are we there yet? <strong>Absolutely not.</strong> Doing something this big requires time, but we are on a successful path that is leading to that spot which is great news. 🎉</p><p>Now let's talk about what has changed in the RC release. ⚡</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_G6Or" id="design-tokens">Design Tokens<a href="#design-tokens" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Design Tokens" title="Direct link to Design Tokens">​</a></h2><p>In order to scale our tokens better to include mobile platforms, we have internally rebuilt the core engine which allows us to move faster and is more organized.

We respect and value your opinion if you don't believe this to be true. ❤️</p><p>Ultimately, this, <a href="https://design.pluralsight.com/docs/development/discover-more/faq#why-doesnt-your-suite-provide-a-components-package" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">along with other reasons</a>, is why we have moved past components and are building something that is more scalable and lightweight in nature.</p><p>Having said that, we also understand there are many people who are not front-end developers that find themselves forced into having to build things on the front end. These are the users who might actually benefit from using a traditional Components Library if they are unwilling to learn the common practices and skills for front-end development.</p><p>So, as a team, we decided to draw up an agreement theorizing how a component library would fit in our suite of tools. What purpose would it solve when working alongside our other packages? Where would the lines in the sand be drawn to prevent duplicated work or responsibility?</p><p>So, we created a discussion on our repo that contains a <strong>poll</strong>. We will be monitoring this for the rest of the year. If there is a large enough response, we will consider creating a components package in the future that follows our agreement guidelines.</p><div class="theme-admonition theme-admonition-tip alert alert--success admonition_dMt1"><div class="admonitionHeading_vYqE"><span class="admonitionIcon_medc"><svg viewBox="0 0 12 16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M6.5 0C3.48 0 1 2.19 1 5c0 .92.55 2.25 1 3 1.34 2.25 1.78 2.78 2 4v1h5v-1c.22-1.22.66-1.75 2-4 .45-.75 1-2.08 1-3 0-2.81-2.48-5-5.5-5zm3.64 7.48c-.25.44-.47.8-.67 1.11-.86 1.41-1.25 2.06-1.45 3.23-.02.05-.02.11-.02.17H5c0-.06 0-.13-.02-.17-.2-1.17-.59-1.83-1.45-3.23-.2-.31-.42-.67-.67-1.11C2.44 6.78 2 5.65 2 5c0-2.2 2.02-4 4.5-4 1.22 0 2.36.42 3.22 1.19C10.55 2.94 11 3.94 11 5c0 .66-.44 1.78-.86 2.48zM4 14h5c-.23 1.14-1.3 2-2.5 2s-2.27-.86-2.5-2z"></path></svg></span>tip</div><div class="admonitionContent_t0cB"><p>To read the agreement and contribute to the poll, <a href="https://github.com/pluralsight/pando/discussions/577" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">check out our Discussion</a>.

until we are "feature complete" for the next month.</p><div class="theme-admonition theme-admonition-tip alert alert--success admonition_dMt1"><div class="admonitionHeading_vYqE"><span class="admonitionIcon_medc"><svg viewBox="0 0 12 16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M6.5 0C3.48 0 1 2.19 1 5c0 .92.55 2.25 1 3 1.34 2.25 1.78 2.78 2 4v1h5v-1c.22-1.22.66-1.75 2-4 .45-.75 1-2.08 1-3 0-2.81-2.48-5-5.5-5zm3.64 7.48c-.25.44-.47.8-.67 1.11-.86 1.41-1.25 2.06-1.45 3.23-.02.05-.02.11-.02.17H5c0-.06 0-.13-.02-.17-.2-1.17-.59-1.83-1.45-3.23-.2-.31-.42-.67-.67-1.11C2.44 6.78 2 5.65 2 5c0-2.2 2.02-4 4.5-4 1.22 0 2.36.42 3.22 1.19C10.55 2.94 11 3.94 11 5c0 .66-.44 1.78-.86 2.48zM4 14h5c-.23 1.14-1.3 2-2.5 2s-2.27-.86-2.5-2z"></path></svg></span>tip</div><div class="admonitionContent_t0cB"><p>To follow our progress this year, check out our <a href="https://github.com/pluralsight/pando/projects/2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2022 Roadmap</a>.

different than your basic UI library (MUI, Chakra, etc.). Libraries like these
are fine for startups, but at some point in time, lose flexibility on projects
or create <strong>major tech debt problems</strong> due to the nature of a component library
depending on many other 3rd party libraries to exist. <strong>Not to mention that natural
security dependency risk this introduces.</strong></p><p>👉 <strong>This is where the PS Design Suite comes in.</strong> 👈</p><p>Instead of building another component
library (which has been done a countless number of ways already), we are building
a family of tools for you to create <strong>your own library that better serves the
needs of your team and project.</strong></p><p>Each package serves a purpose that directly relates to the flexibility you want
to have in your project. You can use them as a single source, or you can combine
them all to create an ultimate solution. It's up to you.</p><p>And the best news is - <strong>our packages are close to 100% dependency free</strong> 🎉.</p><p>No more adding 5 additional dependencies just to use a single UI library. No more
getting security issues in your project because X dependency within another
dependency within another dependency has a security bug.</p><figure style="text-align:center"><iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/SACoDGYTvVNhZYNb5a" width="480" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><figcaption align="center">Mindblown gif</figcaption></figure><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_G6Or" id="headless-styles">Headless Styles<a href="#headless-styles" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Headless Styles" title="Direct link to Headless Styles">​</a></h2><p>We have some new goodies for you:</p><ul><li><strong>NEW</strong> <a href="https://design.pluralsight.com/docs/development/headless-styles/Avatar" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Avatar</a></li><li><strong>NEW</strong> <a href="https://design.pluralsight.com/docs/development/headless-styles/AlertDialog" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alert Dialog</a></li><li><strong>NEW</strong> <a href="https://design.pluralsight.com/docs/development/headless-styles/TextLink" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Text Link</a></li></ul><p>That's right, we now officially have support that for inline text links!
