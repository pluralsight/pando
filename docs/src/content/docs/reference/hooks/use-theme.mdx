## Usage

Pando provides a `useTheme` hook to allow you to easily manage theme state and update the theme of your application. It also allows you to extend and customize themes to fit your needs.

Pando's tokens require a parent theme of `inkyBlue` to access color tokens within the design system. It also has two color mode options built in: `data-color-mode: dark` and `data-color-mode: light` that you can use to toggle light and dark mode on Pando's tokens.

```tsx
import { useTheme } from '@pluralsight/pando/react'

type Modes = 'light' | 'dark' | 'system'
type CustomModes<T extends string> = T | Modes

type Themes = 'inkyBlue'
type CustomThemes<T extends string> = T | Themes

interface ThemeProps {
  updateMode: (mode: string) => void,
  mode: CustomModes<T>,
  updateTheme: (theme: string) => void,
  theme: CustomThemes<T>,
}

useTheme<T extends string, M extends string>(
  initialTheme?: CustomThemes<T>,
  initialMode?: CustomModes<M>,
)

import type { CustomThemes, CustomModes } from '@pluralsight/react/types'
```

## Reference

Call `useTheme` at the root level of your project to store and cache the mode state between re-renders.

```tsx
import { useTheme } from '@pluralsight/react'

export default function App() {
  const { mode, updateMode } = useTheme()

  function handleToggleMode(e) {
    // gets value from a data-color-mode={mode} prop set on a button
    updateMode(e.target.dataset.mode)
  }

  return <div>...</div>
}
```

This hook automatically caches the theme to the `localStorage` Object so that your users will have it saved for as long as they keep the cache alive. ðŸŽ‰

### Parameters

`initialMode`, `initialTheme`: Optional string values of any of the CustomModes or CustomThemes offered or extended via Typescript.

## Extending modes with Typescript

If you are a Typescript user and would like to extend the themes beyond the default options provided, pass in your modes as a type parameter.

```tsx
import type { Modes, Themes } from '@pluralsight/react'

type NewModes = Modes & { 'discotheque' | 'count-chocula' }

const { mode, updateMode } = useTheme<Themes, NewModes>()
```
