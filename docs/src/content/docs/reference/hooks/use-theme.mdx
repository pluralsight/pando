## Usage

Pando provides a `useTheme` hook to allow you to easily manage set and update the theme of your application. It also allows you to extend and customize themes to fit your needs.

Pando's tokens require a parent theme of `inkyBlue` to access color tokens within the design system. It also has two color mode options built in: `data-color-mode="dark"` and `data-color-mode="light"` that you can use to toggle light and dark mode on Pando's tokens. This hook automatically caches the theme to the `localStorage` Object so that your users will have it saved for as long as they keep the cache alive. ðŸŽ‰

### Examples

<UseThemeLiveEditor />

:::tip[inkyBlue and useTheme()]

If you use the `useTheme()` hook in your project, inkyBlue will be automatically set ðŸŽ‰ so you should only need to use the `updateTheme()` function if you are using a custom theme in your project.

## Reference

```tsx
import { useTheme } from '@pluralsight/pando/react'

type Modes = 'light' | 'dark' | 'system'
type CustomModes<T extends string> = T | Modes

type Themes = 'inkyBlue'
type CustomThemes<T extends string> = T | Themes

interface ThemeProps {
  updateMode: (mode: string) => void,
  mode: CustomModes<T>,
  updateTheme: (theme: string) => void,
  theme: CustomThemes<T>,
}

useTheme<T extends string, M extends string>(
  initialTheme?: CustomThemes<T>,
  initialMode?: CustomModes<M>,
)

import type { CustomThemes, CustomModes } from '@pluralsight/react/types'
```

### Parameters

`initialMode`, `initialTheme`: Optional string values of any of the CustomModes or CustomThemes offered or extended via Typescript.

## Extending modes with Typescript

If you are a Typescript user and would like to extend the modes beyond the default options provided, pass in your modes as a type parameter.

```tsx
import { useTheme, type Themes } from '@pluralsight/react'

type NewModes = 'discotheque' | 'count-chocula'

const { mode, updateMode } = useTheme<Themes, NewModes>()
```

## Extending themes with Typescript

If you are a Typescript user and would like to extend the themes beyond the default options provided, pass in your themes as a type parameter.

```tsx
import type { useTheme, type Modes } from '@pluralsight/react'

type NewThemes = 'large-font' | 'no-animation'

const { theme, updateTheme } = useTheme<NewThemes, Modes>()
```

## Example usage in Component

Here is an example of how you might use `useTheme` to manage theme toggling between `light` and `dark` mode in an App component.

Because the `useTheme` hook is designed to update the `localStorage` Object, it should only be used on the client side.

```tsx
function App() {
  const { mode, updateMode } = useTheme()

  function handleToggleMode() {
    const updated = mode === 'light' ? 'dark' : 'light'
    updateMode(updated)
  }

  return (
    <>
      <h2>Hello there!</h2>
      <p>This is an example with Mode toggling!</p>
      <button {...getButtonProps().button} onClick={handleToggleMode}>
        Toggle Mode
      </button>
    </>
  )
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### My theme or mode is not changing when I update it

Make sure you are using a theme name that is either a Pando theme or one that has been defined in your global CSS styling. Otherwise the hook is updating values that are not mapping to any existing styles.

1. Make sure you have followed the Pando <TextLink href="/tutorials/add-pando-to-a-website/step-1/">installation guide</TextLink>.
1. (To use Pando's provided themes and modes) Make sure you are using the correct top level <TextLink href="#usage">theme and mode values</TextLink>.
1. (If you are using a custom theme or mode) Make sure you have a theme defined in your CSS using <TextLink href='/explanation/themes/'>the Pando guidelines</TextLink>.
