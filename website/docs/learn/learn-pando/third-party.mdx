Not all UI libraries are equal. Please be responsible in choosing a UI library. Try to find a tool like Pando that is accessbile to all users.

## CSS Style Objects

Out of the box, Headless-styles exports all of our CSS styles as Javascript Objects to make it as easy as possible to extend 3rd party component libraries like [MUI](https://mui.com/material-ui/customization/theming/), [Chakra](https://chakra-ui.com/docs/styled-system/customize-theme), or whatever the next big library is (ask again next year).

To use our Style Objects, use the naming pattern `<component>Styles` to import from the `/styles` sub-path.

```javascript title="Using Style Objects to extend the Chakra theme" showLineNumbers {1,6,8}
import { buttonStyles } from '@pluralsight/headless-styles/styles'
import { extendTheme } from '@chakra-ui/react'

const theme = {
  button: {
    baseStyles: buttonStyles.pando_actionButton,
    variants: {
      text: buttonStyles.pando_textButton,
      ...
    }
  }
}
```

Most of the common UI libraries support this pattern, so you should be able to use this example whether you use MUI or any other UI component library.

Additionally, our Style Objects use the nested selector pattern that is accepted by most libraries. You will need to validate which rules the integration you plan on using implements in order to ensure that you will not need to update the data.

```javascript title="Example of what a Style Object may look like"
pando_actionButton: {
  backgroundColor: 'var(--ps-action-background)',
  color: 'var(--ps-action-text)',
  '&:hover:not(:disabled)': {
    backgroundColor: 'var(--ps-action-background-hover)',
  },
  '&:active:not(:disabled)': {
    backgroundColor: 'var(--ps-action-background-active)',
  },
},
```
