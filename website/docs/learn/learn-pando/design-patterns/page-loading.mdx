In order to provide a great user experience, you should design and develop initial Page Loading experiences to be handled differently than updating a section of the page _after_ the page has loaded.

## Page Loading vs. Content Loading

Let's define what we actually mean when we say the words "page loading". In a browser experience there is typically a lifecycle of a page regarding rendering content: Page Loading and Content Loading.

### Page Loading

Page loading refers to the initial page rendering when you **first land on a web-page/route**. For example, if you go to pluralsight.com and your dashboard (assuming you are logged in) for the first time, you may get a Dashboard page that has to initially load different types of information from the server in order to display the page you are supposed to be viewing.

> Page Loading is when the browser fetches and displays a web page for the first time upon going to a specific route/URL.

### Content Loading

After the browser has finished the Page Loading stage, there may be a button that will **update some information** on that page when you click it, this is known as Content Loading.

> Content Loading is when the browser updates a specific section of UI within a previously loaded web page.

Now that you are more familiar with what we mean by Page Loading, let's discuss the pattern we recommend using.

## Skeletons for Page Loading

In Pando, we recommend the use of Skeletons for initial Page Loading experiences.

In this example, we are creating a Fallback component for a Profile Section.

```jsx live
function FallbackFeature() {
  return (
    <div style={{ display: 'flex', width: '100%' }}>
      <Skeleton kind="circle" />
      <div style={{ paddingInlineStart: '1rem', width: '50%' }}>
        <Skeleton kind="text" />
        <Skeleton kind="text" style={{ width: '6rem' }} />
        <Skeleton>
          <h2 style={{ visibility: 'hidden' }}>Some Title</h2>
          <p>A description of the content.</p>
        </Skeleton>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

:::tip Keeping Code Clean

Whenever you are creating a fallback component, it is best to keep it in the same file from the component that will be rendered. This will help keep your code clean and easy to maintain.

### Using with React.Suspense

If you use React, you can easily create a Skeleton layout of what you want to display, then use the [`Suspense`](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-api.html#reactsuspense) tag to automagically manage when they will appear and dissapear.

In the example below, we are using the [Avatar](../../../reference/components/avatar.mdx) component which uses the `Suspense` tag to display a fallback component while the image is loading internally.

<iframe
  src="https://codesandbox.io/embed/ps-react-forked-5429oc?fontsize=14&hidenavigation=1&theme=dark"
  style={{
    width: '100%',
    height: '500px',
    border: '0',
    borderRadius: '4px',
    overflow: 'hidden',
  }}
  title="Preloaded Avatar Example"
  allow="accelerometer; ambient-light-sensor; camera; encrypted-media; geolocation; gyroscope; hid; microphone; midi; payment; usb; vr; xr-spatial-tracking"
  sandbox="allow-forms allow-modals allow-popups allow-presentation allow-same-origin allow-scripts"
></iframe>

## Circular Progress for Content Loading

Whenever you need to display a loading state within a section of a page that needs updating (i.e. has already initially loaded), use the Circular Progress.

Because this example requires more verbose code to mimic a data update, we will use a Sandbox preview:

<iframe
  src="https://codesandbox.io/embed/epic-herschel-kdnlv3?fontsize=14&hidenavigation=1&theme=dark&view=preview"
  style={{
    width: '100%',
    height: '500px',
    border: 0,
    borderRadius: '4px',
    overflow: 'hidden',
  }}
  title="epic-herschel-kdnlv3"
  allow="accelerometer; ambient-light-sensor; camera; encrypted-media; geolocation; gyroscope; hid; microphone; midi; payment; usb; vr; xr-spatial-tracking"
  sandbox="allow-forms allow-modals allow-popups allow-presentation allow-same-origin allow-scripts"
></iframe>
