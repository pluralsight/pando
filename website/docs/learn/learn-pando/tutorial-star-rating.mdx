### What are you building?

In this tutorial, you'll build a StarRating component with Pando Headless-styles and React.

You can see what it will look like when you're finished here:

```jsx live
function StarRatingSystem() {
  return (
    <ul>
      <li>star 1</li>
      <li>star 2</li>
      <li>star 3</li>
      <li>star 4</li>
      <li>star 5</li>
    </ul>
  )
}
```
