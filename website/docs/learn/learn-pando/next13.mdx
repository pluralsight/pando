:::tip Pando supports Server Components

Pando is compatible with Server components out of the box by providing plain CSS.

:::

[NextJS](https://beta.nextjs.org/docs/getting-started) is a powerful tool that allows developers to build custom React apps that utilize the power of server rendering.

In version 13, the Next team decided to restructure the project to use [Server Components](https://beta.nextjs.org/docs/rendering/server-and-client-components) which means that if you would like to take advantage of this feature, you will need to take a slightly different approach to your development.

:::note

This article assumes you are already familiar with Next 13. If you are not, we recommend you [learn the fundamentals](https://beta.nextjs.org/docs/getting-started) before continuing.

## Setup

There is no additional setup required for NextJS outside of the **first two steps** in the [Adding Pando to a website](../get-started/installation/add-to-website.mdx) page.

## Using Server Components

When you are building components that don't require any client-side features from React, you can use any API provided by the Headless-styles or most all from the React package (i.e. we have some client-only components).

### Knowing when to use Server Components

In order to determine whether you should use a Server Component or Client is easier than it seems.

**Server Components should be used when a component doesn't require any React hooks/events.**

This means, if you have a component that doesn't use any hooks or click events, you can and should use a Server Component to help performance.

In this example, we are creating a global Nav Server Component:

```typescript showLineNumbers title="Creating a Nav Component"
import { Grid, GridItem, Icon } from '@pluralsight/react'
import { HomeIcon, BriefcaseIcon } from '@pluralsight/icons'
import Link from 'next/link'
import { type PropsWithChildren } from 'react'
import styles from './nav.module.css'

function NavListItem(props: PropsWithChildren<{}>) {
  return (
    <GridItem className={styles.listItem} cols="6">
      {props.children}
    </GridItem>
  )
}

interface NavLinkProps {
  href: string
  icon: any
}

function NavLink(props: PropsWithChildren<NavLinkProps>) {
  return (
    <Link href={props.href}>
      <Icon icon={props.icon} />
      {props.children}
    </Link>
  )
}

export default function Nav() {
  return (
    <nav className={styles.container}>
      <Grid className={styles.navList} cols="12" gap={6}>
        <NavListItem>
          <NavLink href="/" icon={HomeIcon}>
            Home
          </NavLink>
        </NavListItem>

        <NavListItem>
          <NavLink href="/work" icon={BriefcaseIcon}>
            Work
          </NavLink>
        </NavListItem>
      </Grid>
    </nav>
  )
}
```

## Using Client Components

Whenever you need to build a component that uses advanced React functionality like hooks or click events, you can use any of the Headless-styles or React APIs.

Here is an example of creating a Button Client Component:

```typescript showLineNumbers title="Button Component"
'use client'

import { Button } from '@pluralsight/react'
import type { HTMLProps, PropsWithChildren } from 'react'

export default function SomeFeature(props: PropsWithChildren<{}>) {
  const { children, onClick, ...btnProps } = props

  return (
    <Button {...button} onClick={props.onClick}>
      {props.children}
    </Button>
  )
}
```
