Kathy has a strong focus on the human side of software and is always thinking about how what she builds impacts the users and developers that will interact with it. Outside of code she's a wife, "mama" to a little kid and a very old cat, and loves baking cakes, quilting, and trying to keeps plants alive.

### Design

#### Brad Bice (he/him)

Brad is a father of 2, husband, and janitor for his cat. He spends his free time building Lego with his kids, watching the latest trending TV shows, losing at video games, putzing in his garage, and playing volleyball.
