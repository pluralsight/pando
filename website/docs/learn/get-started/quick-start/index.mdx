Welcome to the Pando documentation! This page will give you an introduction, from a design and developer experience, to the majority of the Pando concepts that you will use on a daily basis.

## Using Themes

Pando ships with theme support using design-tokens that utilize a semantic naming convention. This means that our themes are created to scale and be easily used for both the design and developer experience.

```bash
# "usage" is the only required property

ps-[sentiment?]-[usage]-[prominence?]-[interaction?]
```

- **Sentiment** - "default", "action", "info", "success", "warning", "danger"
- **Usage (required)** - "background", "border", "navigation", "surface", "text"
- **Prominence** - "default", "weak", "medium", "strong", "inverse"
- **Interaction** - "default", "hover", "active", "visited"

What this looks like in terms of an actual token can be seen in an example of some of the tokens:

```css title="Example of tokens (not actual values)"
:root {
  --ps-border-weak: #000;
  --ps-text: #000;
  --ps-action-text: #fff;
  --ps-action-background-hover: #fff1;
}
```

## Adding styles and Accessibility

In Pando, our Headless-styles library is responsible for styling components and making sure they are accessbile. We do this by providing a library of Javascript helper functions that deliver the component props you need so you can spread them onto your component.

It looks something like this:

```jsx live
function Button() {
  return <button {...getButtonProps().button}>Action</button>
}
```

This approach allows Pando to increase the performance of your application by relying on the use of Semantic HTML and plain JSX.

## Using Icons

Icons help enhance our pages and features. Our Icons library was created to provide icons for different solutions, including: React, Svelte, and SVG icons.

```jsx live
function IconButton() {
  const { button, iconOptions } = getIconButtonProps()
  return (
    <button {...button}>
      <PlaceholderIcon {...getIconProps(iconOptions)} />
    </button>
  )
}
```

Here you can see how some of our Headless-styles API work together to help the developer experience!

## Advanced React Logic

When building more complex components, you may need some additional logic. In these scenarios, our React-utils library provides custom hooks and helpers to advance your components in a scalable way:

```jsx showLineNumbers
import { getButtonProps } from '@pluralsight/headless-styles'
import { useTheme } from '@pluralsight/react-utils'

function ThemeSwitcher() {
  const { theme, updateTheme } = useTheme()

  function handleToggleTheme() {
    const newTheme = theme === 'light' ? 'dark' : 'light'
    updateTheme(newTheme)
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <button {...getButtonProps().button} onClick={handleToggleTheme}>
        Toggle Theme
      </button>

      <code>Theme: {theme} </code>
    </div>
  )
}
```
