<p className="size-xxl">A hook for pre-loading image assets in the browser.</p>

## Import

```javascript
import { usePreloadedImage } from '@pluralsight/react-utils'
```

```typescript
type ImgProps = ImgHTMLAttributes<HTMLImageElement>

usePreloadedImg(imgOptions: ImgProps)
```

## Reference

Call `usePreloadedImage` at the top level of the component you would like to pre-load an image into:

:::tip Use with Suspense

Wrap your Image components in a `Suspense` component to display a better UI experience for your users.

:::

```jsx showLineNumbers {2,11,18,20,23}
function Image(props) {
  const img = props.imgData.read()
  return (
    <div>
      <img {...img} />
    </div>
  )
}

export default function PreloadedImg() {
  const resource = usePreloadedImg({
    alt: 'random image',
    src: 'https://source.unsplash.com/random/?face&fit=facearea&facepad=2&w=256&h=256&q=80',
  })

  return (
    <div className="App-container">
      {resource && (
        <Suspense fallback={<Fallback />}>
          <Image alt="test image" imgData={resource.img} />
        </Suspense>
      )}
      {!resource && null}
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Parameters

This hook accepts any property that you can place onto an `img` element.

### Returns

An Object containing a `img` property that is an Object containing a `read` function which returns a Promise that delivers all the `image` attributes when it has successfully fetched an image. Additionally, it contains a `data` property that contains meta-data that might be useful in a unique scenario (you will most likely never need to use this).

## Troubleshooting

### My images are not loading correctly

If there is a problem with the initial loading of your images, please validate the options being passed in are [valid img element attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img#attributes).

### Suspense is not working when I use it with this hook

If you are combing the use of the `Suspense` component with this hook, ensure that you have it wrapping at the correct level. The Suspense tag should be wrapped around the component that _contains_ the hook (it's parent level).
