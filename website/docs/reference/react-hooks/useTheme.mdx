## Import

```javascript
import { useTheme } from '@pluralsight/react-utils'
```

```typescript
type Themes = 'light' | 'dark' | 'system'
type CustomThemes<T extends string> = T | Themes

interface ThemeProps {
  updateTheme: (theme: string) => void,
  theme: CustomThemes<T>,
}

useTheme<T extends string>(initialTheme?: CustomThemes<T>): ThemeProps
```

```javascript
import type { CustomThemes } from '@pluralsight/react-utils/types'
```

## Reference

Call `useTheme` at the top level of your component to store and cache the theme state between re-renders:

```jsx showLineNumbers {4}
import { useTheme } from '@pluralsight/react-utils'

export default function App() {
  const { theme, updateTheme } = useTheme()

  function handleToggleTheme(e) {
    // gets value from a data-theme={theme} prop set on a button
    updateTheme(e.target.dataset.theme)
  }

  return <div>...</div>
}
```

:::tip Automatic Theme Caching

This hook automatically caches the theme to the `localStorage` Object so that your users will have it saved for as long as they keep the cache alive. :tada:

:::

### Parameters

- `initialTheme`: A optional string value of any of the CustomThemes offered or extended via Typescript.

## Extending themes with Typescript

If you are a Typescript user and would like to extend the themes beyond the default options provided, just pass in your themes as a type parameter.

```typescript
type NewThemes = 'pizza-sight' | 'flow-dark'
const { theme, updateTheme } = useTheme<NewThemes>()
```

## Example usage in Component (Client-side)

Here is an example of how you might use `useTheme` to manage theme toggling between `light` and `dark` mode in an App component.

:::info Client-side API

The `useTheme` hook is should only be used on the client side due to its design
of updating the `localStorage` Object.

:::

```jsx showLineNumbers {2}
function App() {
  const { theme, updateTheme } = useTheme()

  function handleToggleTheme() {
    const newTheme = theme === 'light' ? 'dark' : 'light'
    updateTheme(newTheme)
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <div>
        <h2>Hello there!</h2>
        <p>This is an example with Theme toggling!</p>
        <button {...getButtonProps().button} onClick={handleToggleTheme}>
          Toggle Theme
        </button>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

## SSR Helpers

If you are using a SSR app (like [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/)) we provide some
additional helpers if you are unable to use the hook on the client-side.

```javascript
import { getCachedTheme, setCachedTheme } from '@pluralsight/react-utils'
```

:::info

These helpers use the `window` object conditionally to try and help prevent
SSR errors.

## Troubleshooting

### My theme is not changing when I update it

Make sure you are using a theme name that is either a Pando theme or one that has been defined in your global CSS styling. This means the hook is updating values that are not mapping to any styles with the browser.

1. Make sure you have followed the Pando [installation guide](../../learn/get-started/installation/index.mdx).
2. Make sure you are using the [correct theme names](#import).
3. Make sure you have a theme defined in your CSS using the [Pando guidelines](../general/themes/index.mdx).
