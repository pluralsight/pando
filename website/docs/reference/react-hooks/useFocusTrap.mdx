## Import

```javascript
import { useFocusTrap } from '@pluralsight/react-utils'
```

```typescript
useFocusTrap(triggerRef: RefObject<HTMLButton>)
```

## Reference

Call `useFocusTrap` at the top level of the component you wish to trap the focus within:

```jsx showLineNumbers {3,6,14}
function AlertDialog(props, triggerRef) {
  const { onClose, ...alertProps } = props
  const { ref, onKeyDown, setupFocusTrap } = useFocusTrap(triggerRef)

  useEffect(() => {
    setupFocusTrap()
  }, [setupFocusTrap])

  return (
    <div {...alert.backdrop}>
      <div {...alert.focusGuard} />

      <div {...alert.wrapper} ref={wrapperRef} onClick={handleBackdropClick}>
        <section {...alert.section} ref={ref} onKeyDown={onKeyDown}>
  )
}
```

### Parameters

- `triggerRef`: a reference using `useRef` placed on the trigger element that is responsible for displaying the Dialog/Modal (usually a Button).

### Returns

An Object containing a `ref` property to place on the element you would like to trap the focus within. A `onKeyDown` event to place on the same element as the `ref` property to watch for "Tab" events within that section. A `setupFocusTrap` function to be called in a `useEffect` hook with nothing else in the dependency Array to setup the hook when the component has rendered for the first time.

## Troubleshooting

### My hook isn't trapping the focus

Make sure you are placing the [Return Props](#returns) on the right elements and that you are calling the `setupFocusTrap` function in an Effect by itself.

1. `ref` and `onKeyDown` should be placed on the same element that contains the focusable content.
2. The `setupFocusTrap` should be in an Effect by itself to ensure it is only called when the component has mounted for the first time.
