    We believe everyone should enjoy our user experiences.

**Accessibility by nature** is our foundational company value for our products and brand. We understand there is a wide range of human experiences and abilities that require a unique experience for each use-case.

At Pluralsight, we have an a11y team (of people who actually require a11y software) that is devoted to ensuring everything we do from the colors we present to our engineering code bases are being executed at the highest level to ensure we are providing enhanced usable experiences for all people.

## Colors

The themes we provide in our [Design Tokens](../development/tokens/intro.md) meet passing constrast standards and are also **colorblind friendly by default** (we test with actual colorblind teammates and not using software that mimics what it thinks people see - typically wrong in most cases).

## Software

Our a11y team validates all of our [Development APIs](../development/getting-started/installation.md) to ensure we are providing a passing WCAG compliance standard with each feature.
