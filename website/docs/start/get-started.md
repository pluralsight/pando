  <p className="page-subheadline size-xl" markdown="1">An introduction to the Pluralsight Design Suite and its core concepts.</p>
</strong>

Welcome to the Pluralsight Design Suite! :wave: This is our single-source of truth for building user experiences using the Pluralsight Brand. We have four resources for you to use throughout your journey here: Start here, [design](../design/intro.md), [development](../development/getting-started/installation.md), and our [blog](../../blog/).

## Design

This is your section for all things Design and Branding. From guidelines to design tools like our Figma Design Kit - you can find it here.

<!-- TODO - add visual link boxes to stuff to make the page more interesting -->

## Development

For the engineers who are looking for UI libraries that execute the Design Kit, this is your section. We have everything from [Design Tokens](../development/tokens/intro.md) to [React Utils](../development/react-utils/intro.mdx) for helping reduce and solidify your codebase.

## Blog

This is where we announce our releases for both Design and Development. If you are looking for a deep dive into what has changed, where things are going, or theory behind our decisions - you will find it here.
