# Intro

:::caution

This is **experimental** documentation for Pluralsight Design **icons** package.

:::

<p class="page-subheadline" markdown="1">
  The icons package provides icons ready to insert into your application as
  inline SVG elements.
</p>

Icons are used to convey meaning at a glance, therefore it is important that their usage is consistent and that any meaning conveyed visually is also available to those without vision.

## SVG vs. icon font

After a [thorough and unbiased comparison of the performance and quality of icon fonts vs inline SVG](https://github.com/pluralsight/tva/discussions/70) we determined that the most performant approach will be to use inline SVG elements. In the [RFC for the Icons package](https://github.com/pluralsight/tva-rfcs/blob/main/text/0000-icons.md) we continued to refine our approach for delivering and rendering icons on the web.

## Icon labels and accessibility

An [accessible label](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-label) is included in each SVG.
In most cases the label describes the image (e.g., "arrow pointing left"), in others what it represents (e.g., "exit fullscreen").

**By default, the label will be read by screen readers.** The label may be overridden or disabled when a different label is needed or provided as part of a higher-order component (such as a button).

```xml
<svg
  aria-label="arrow pointing right"
  viewBox="0 -2 18 18"
  role="img"
  fill="currentColor"
  class="ps-icon-svg"
>
  <path d="M9.864 13.01a.5.5 0 0 1 0-.708L14.166 8H.5a.5.5 0 0 1-.5-.5v-1A.5.5 0 0 1 .5
  6h13.668L9.864 1.696a.5.5 0 0 1 0-.708l.707-.707a.5.5 0 0 1 .707 0l6.364 6.364a.5.5
  0 0 1 0 .707l-6.364 6.364a.5.5 0 0 1-.707 0l-.707-.707Z"/>
</svg>
```

:::tip

If an icon provides meaning visually, be sure to provide the same meaning in the icon's `aria-label`.
For example, the icon in this link:
[W3C: Functional Images <ExternalLinkIcon className={getIconProps().className} aria-label="opens in new window" />](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/functional/)
visually indicates that the link opens in a new window.
In this case we should add `aria-label="opens in new window"` to the icon.

## Bundlers without tree shaking

Tree shaking of `@pluralsight/icons` works out of the box in modern frameworks.
If you're using ES6 modules and a bundler that supports tree shaking you can safely use named imports and still get an optimized bundle size automatically:

```javascript
import { BookmarkIcon, MenuIcon } from '@pluralsight/icons'
```

Without tree shaking, you can reduce your bundle size by directly importing the icons you need with a pathed import.
To do this, append the framework and category to the path.

### React

```javascript
import PlayIcon from '@pluralsight/icons/react/audio-video/PlayIcon'
```

### Svelte

```javascript
import PlayIcon from '@pluralsight/icons/svelte/audio-video/PlayIcon'
```

### SVG

```javascript
import playSvg from '@pluralsight/icons/svg/audio-video/play.svg'
```

:::tip

Some systems may not support the package.json `exports` field.
If the pathed imports are not working, you may need to reference the file directly.
To do this, prepend `build/` to the path, and, in some cases, append the file extension.

`import PlayIcon from '@pluralsight/icons/build/svelte/audio-video/PlayIcon.svelte'`
