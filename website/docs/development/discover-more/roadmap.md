The roadmap is a living document, and it is likely that priorities will change, but the information below should give some indication of our plans for the next major release, and for the future.

## Methodology

The Pando codebase is community driven - issues that resonate most with the community get the most attention. Please **upvote** (:thumbsup:) on Github the issues you are most interested in.

## Priorities

Here are the top priorities:

- **Official Release.**. :rocket: 2023 will be a big year for us and our goal is to get this library out and ready for all of our users (web and mobile) to set a new standard in tools that are available to developers.
- **Design.** :lipstick: The Pluralsight brand is ever evolving and we will be the most up to date developer resource for it.
- **Better documentation.** :books: There is no perfect documentation and we will strive to continue to get to that standard with each release and community contribution.
- **Performance.** :racing_car: With every decision we make, we must stay extremely lightweight and performant. This is will always be our priority to you.
- **Flexibility**. ðŸ§˜ One of the biggest challenges we face is being truly flexible in an ever changing frontend environment. Making React components (or any other library) only helps the small audience of those users. Our goal is to ensure we are creating something bigger than any UI framework or library which comes into existence so that we can have a larger community of users and contributers.
- **Typescript** :mechanical_arm: The codebase is mostly written in Typescript and we will have definitions available in every package we offer.
- **Accessibility** :deaf_woman: Pluralsight puts a high focus on a11y and we will keep a very strong priority in making sure we are delivering the most accessbile library we can create - from screen readers, down to colorblindess. We are here for you!

## Quarterly Roadmap

We offer two roadmaps in our Github repo (Pando): a yearly breakdown by the quarters and a weekly view. Both of these give you a high-level understanding of what we are planning to accomplish by the week and each quarter.
