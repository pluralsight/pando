#### Learn how to contribute to the TVA project!

We've tried to make contributing to TVA as easy as possible. In most cases, you don't even need an IDE! For an in depth guide to contributing, please see our [guidelines docs](https://github.com/pluralsight/tva/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

You can also Check out the Support page for info about [creating issues](../getting-started/support#new-issue-guidelines) and our FAQ page on [other ways](../getting-started/faq#i-%EF%B8%8F-tva-how-can-i-support-the-project) to help support us.
