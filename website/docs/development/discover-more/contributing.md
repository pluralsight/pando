  </p>
</strong>

We've tried to make contributing to Pluralsight Design as easy as possible. In most cases, you don't even need an IDE! For an in depth guide to contributing, please see our [guidelines docs](https://github.com/pluralsight/tva/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

You can also Check out the Support page for info about [creating issues](./getting-started/support.md#new-issue-guidelines) and our FAQ page on [other ways](./getting-started/faq.md#i-%EF%B8%8F-tva-how-can-i-support-the-project) to help support us.
