## Community help

Welcome to the community! These are all the resources you can find for questions and advice about the UI library.

### Github

TVA uses Github issues as a bug and feature request tracker. If you think you have found a bug, or have a new feature idea, please start by making sure it hasn't already been [reported or fixed](https://github.com/pluralsight/tva/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed). You can search through existing issues, pull requests, and discussions to see if someone has reported one similar to yours.

**Issue Steps**

1. Check if issue has already been reported or closed
2. Check if discussion has been created
3. If you answered "no" to 1 and 2, [open an issue on TVA](https://github.com/pluralsight/tva/issues/new/choose)

### New issue guidelines

- Please follow the issue template.
- Please begin the title with '[type]' if the template did not provide one, and use a succint description that helps others find similar issues.
  - "Button doesn't work" ‚ùå
  - "[feature]: add support for Button with..." ‚úÖ
- Please don't group multiple issues in a single topic - each should have it's own issue instead.
- Please don't comment "+1" on an issue. It spams the maintainers and doesn't help move the issue forward. Use Github reactions instead (üëç).

## Supported versions

TVA Core has been open-source ([Apache 2.0](https://github.com/pluralsight/tva/blob/main/LICENSE)) since the very beginning, and always will be. Developers can ensure TVA is the right choice for any of their applications through TVA's community maintenance strategy. The TVA team regularly ships new releases, bug fixes, and is very welcoming to community pull requests.

Given the reality of time and resource constraints, as well as the desire to keep innovating, over time it becomes necessary to shift focus to newer versions of the framework ([our release schedule](../discover-more/roadmap)), while making the transition to newer versions as smooth as possible, including publishing migration guides. The open-source community is always welcome to submit new features and bug fixes as well.
