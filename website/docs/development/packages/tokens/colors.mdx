# Colors

:::caution
This is **alpha** documentation for the **design-tokens** package.
:::

## Installation

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @pluralsight/design-tokens@alpha
```

:::tip
The `headless-styles` package will consume the `css` and `js` tokens internally. Depending on which setup you use (css vs. CSS-in-JS) will either return the styles being referenced from the tokens, or the tokens themselves (CSS-in-JS only). This means **you do not need to install this package** if you are using `headless-styles`.
:::

## List of tokens

These are the default values (dark) we provide. For every theme, we simply overwrite the values needed shown in this list (i.e. token names are the same for all themes).

The tokens are presented in alphabetical order.

<TokensColorMap />

## Themes

The `design-tokens` package comes with two themes: `light` and `dark` (default). Themes are controlled by using CSS classes (i.e., `.light`) or a `data-theme` attribute on the `html` tag. The default token values that you will receive will be for the `dark` theme. If you want to use the `light` theme, simply add a class name of `light` a parent component or `data-theme="light"` to the `html` tag for a full page switch (what we do in these docs).

If you want to change the theme of a specific child, just add the `light` class name to the parent of that component.

:::caution
Themes **depend on the normalize.css** file to be used in your project. Check out our [getting started](../../getting-started/installation.md#normalizecss) docs to learn how to add the normalize.css file to your project.

### Example solutions for CSS-in-JS

If you choose to use the `design-tokens` in a CSS-in-JS environment, we ship both the light and dark tokens. Just use the same color map we have provided above and add "Light" after the "ps" ID (i.e. `psBackground` becomes `psLightBackground`).

If you are using React, there are a number of solutions you can use to create theme switching in your project.

- Add a `light` class name or class toggle to your root element
- Create a state-based solution or `context` in your project
- Create a custom hook that dynamically imports a map of colors depending on what you pass into it (i.e. "light", "dark"). However, we do not recommend this approach for performance reasons but provide it as an example to show your creativity limits what is possible.

## Custom Theming

Our semantic-token based system allows for easily customizing themes to meet the needs of your team. Instead of adding new tokens, simply overwrite the tokens we provide in the list above. We default the `:root` to use dark mode and only overwrite for any theme outside of that (i.e. "light", etc.).

### CSS custom theming

In CSS all you need to do is to overwrite [the tokens](#list-of-tokens) you want to update in the `:root` CSS selector in your project for dark mode.

```css title="Global CSS file for your project"
:root {
  --ps-text: #fff;
}
```

To create your own light theme, you will need to do the exact same thing, except target our "light" selectors.

```css title="Global CSS file for your project"
html[data-theme='light'],
.light {
  --ps-text: #000;
}
```

### JS custom theming

Due to the nature of our CSS-in-JS design in [headless-styles](../headless-styles/Button.mdx), you can extend our components to use whichever custom theme solution you prefer with your chosen library (i.e. styled-components, emotion, etc.).

See the [Button example](../headless-styles/Button.mdx#extending) for more details.

## Custom Tokens

Because we limit tokens to our semantic color theme framework (which should provide you with anything you will more than likely ever need), your team may feel the need to extend and add additional variables to your project. In this scenario, for performance reasons, **you should use static variables when you need a color/value not in the list**. Additional tokens will start to compound and negatively affect the performance of page loads.

There's no doubt that using tokens makes life easier, however, when it starts to be used so much it negatively affects the customer experience - we have failed as a team. So if your team would like to define a large number of tokens to make your code seem more valuable, **we highly recommend the use of SASS in your project which will produce the most performant outcome in this scenario.**

### SASS tokens

SASS tokens differ from CSS variables in that they are pre-processed out of existence and into your code base. This means that when you use SASS, there are no tokens that are stored in browser memory. This is a **huge** benefit because you can essentially create as many tokens as you want with **no negative side effects to performance.**
