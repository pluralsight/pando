# Colors

:::caution
This is **unreleased** documentation for the **tokens** package.
:::

## Installation

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @pluralsight/design-tokens
```

:::tip
The `headless-styles` package will consume the `css` and `js` tokens internally and depending on which setup you use (css vs. CSS-in-JS) will either return the styles being referenced from the tokens, or the tokens themselves (CSS-in-JS only). This means **you do not need to install this package** if you are using `headless-styles`.
