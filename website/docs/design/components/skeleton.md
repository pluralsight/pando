## Description

Provides a low-fi representation of content as a loading state.

## Anatomy/Structure

1. Circle
2. Content

## Usage

- Use skeletons to represent content that has not yet loaded, to provide users with a feeling of faster rendering of the page.
- Could be used for content descriptions, section introductions, images, and more.
- Skeletons can also be used for some non-typographic content such as forms.
- Match the number of lines (approximately) and content being replaced, to accurately represent the loading content.
- Use Skeletons for dynamic content, not for static content that will not be loaded in.
- Skeleton shapes should be resized and duplicated as needed to accurately represent the content they are replacing.
- The color of the Skeleton elements can be replaced with a contextually appropriate value.

### Types

- **Content:** Use for blocks of content or lines of text.
- **Circle:** Use for imagery and larger blocks of content.

### Dos and don'ts

- Do use Skeletons for dynamic text and content that will be replaced as the page loads.
- Do not use Skeletons for static content, or use placeholder content for dynamic content.
- Do not use Skeleton for in-progress operations, such as file transfers. Instead, use Progress.
