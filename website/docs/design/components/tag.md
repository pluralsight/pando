## Description

A label for definition, categorization, and navigation.

## Anatomy/Structure

- Tag
  - Icon (optional)
  - Label

## Usage

- Tags are meant for supplementary and categorical reference.
- Lists of Tags should be presented directly below the content they represent, as the last element in that content group.
- Display tags as horizontal lists, wrapping to new lines if needed.

### Types

- Default
  - The default tag acts as a hyperlink to another page containing a list of all similarly tagged content.
- No-link
  - No-link tags can be used when only categorizing a piece of content and linking behavior is either not applicable or not intended.

### Sizes

- M (default)
  - Use the default size in most cases.
- S
  - Use small whenever space is at a premium, e.g. inside of a small card or in a sidebar.

### Dos and donâ€™ts

- Do not use only icons or emoji within Tags.

### Best practices

- Tags, while providing value, do add more visual noise. Use them in moderation, trying to keep to no more than 3 rows of tags in any configuration.
- Tags can be thought of as alternate search words. What other terms or categories does this particular piece of content fall into or reference?

## Content Guidance

### Microcopy

- Tags should use sentence casing.
- Tag labels will not wrap, so longer tags will move to a new line if needed.
- Keep tag labels under 30 characters.

## Behavior

- Tags adopt the same text styles, states, and behaviors as Text Links.
