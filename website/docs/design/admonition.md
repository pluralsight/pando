## Usage

### Sentiments

- Info
  - Conveys information that assists users to understand system states or contextual changes in their experience. Brings awareness to important information and sets expectations for the user.
- Success
  - Provides the user with positive confirmation of a successfully performed action or series of steps.
- Warning
  - A warning helps users avoid error situations and should communicate important or time-sensitive states of the system. Consists of a description of potential system limitations or errors as a result of user actions. It should provide a recommended next step.
- Danger
  - Alerts of a problem that has already occurred, as a result of user actions. It should provide recommended next steps, or a path forward.

### Dos and don'ts

- Do not alter the admonition template. Maintain all elements for a consistent experience for the user.

## Content Guidance

### Microcopy

- For Danger or warning text, when directing users, do not use words such as "please", just concisely direct the user as needed.
- Punctuate the titles with a period or exclamation point (eg. Success!)

### Content considerations

- Title
  - Titles are a required element, and should be short and descriptive.
- Description
  - Descriptions should be kept to 2 or less sentences, if possible.
  - Descriptions should be clear, concise, and include any troubleshooting actions or next steps as applicable.
  - Include links as necessary with descriptions that redirect users to next or helpful steps.

## Accessibility

## Behavior

- Placement

  - Admonitions should be placed at the top of the current content area, to capture the attention of users or be read as quickly as possible.
  - When associated with forms, Admonitions should be placed at the beginning of the form content.

- Close button
  - Include the close button when the admonition is communicating a real-time response or status to the user, allowing them to dismiss the message. For in-content admonitions (usually warnings or informative messages) do not include a close button so that these messages aren't lost.
- Icons
  - Maintain the icons associated with each sentiment, and do not swap them for another source icon.
