## Style

- We generally follow AP style in our marketing copy.
- Merriam-Webster is our source of truth on spelling and treatment of words with the exception, of course, of brand- or industry-specific language that goes against the grain.
- We default to American English spelling, but obviously tailor our spelling to Australian/UK English when necessary.

### Exceptions to AP style

- We don't put periods in between acronyms, including academic degrees (AS, BA, MA, MD, PhD).
- Remember that official names of degrees are in title case, while general reference to a type of degree (bachelor's, master's, etc.) is not.
- Also, do not capitalize the major unless it's part of the official name of the degree:

##### Examples

- Bachelor of Arts/bachelor's degree
- Master of Science/master's degree
- Associate of Science/associate degree (no possessive)
- "She received a bachelor's degree in arts."
- "She graduated from NYU with a Bachelor of Arts."

### Okay

It's always "okay," not "OK."

## Acronyms

When abbreviating a phrase, whether it's the name of a certification, process, etc., spell it out first, put the acronym in parentheses, and then use the abbreviated version moving forward.

### Example

- "Software as a service (SaaS) is sometimes referred to as on-demand software. SaaS is a software delivery model."
- "Microsoft has revamped its Microsoft Certified Solutions Expert (MCSE) designation. The company retired the MCSE in"

### Exceptions

It's okay to use an acronym on the word's first mention when the abbreviation is more widely known than the full spelling; e.g., HTML, URL, OS.

## Punctuation

### Ampersands

Avoid using ampersands in body copy, but they may be appropriate in ads or places where character counts are an issue. Do not use a comma before an ampersand.

### Apostrophes

With possessive apostrophes for plural words, the apostrophe follows the "s" without an additional "s." The same rule applies for proper nouns ending in "s."

##### Correct

- The employees' invention (if referring to an invention by all the employees)
- The employee's invention (if an individual employee invented something)
- "Has anyone seen Jess' laptop?"
- "Starbucks' menu should have pumpkin spice year round."
- You can often avoid the apostrophe with proper nouns ending in "s" by rewording the sentence: "The menu at Starbucks should have pumpkin spice year round."

##### Incorrect

- The employees's invention
- "Has anyone seen Jess's laptop?"
- "Starbucks's menu should have pumpkin spice year round."

Be careful with apostrophes. Remember that they indicate a contraction (it's, can't, don't) or possession, as in the example above. People will commonly insert apostrophes where they're unnecessary because they "feel" necessary. Here are some common (including Pluralsight-specific) examples:

##### Correct

- Dos and don'ts
- Skill IQs
- Cross your Ts and dot your Is

##### Incorrect

- Do's and don'ts
- Skill IQ's
- Cross your T's and dot your I's

### Commas

#### Serial (or Oxford) comma

We do use a serial comma (a comma in front of the final conjunction connecting three or more list items). A serial comma helps readers more easily interpret lists by clearly separating their items.

##### Example

- "At Pluralsight, we're big fans of pizza, Indian, and Chinese food." NOT "At Pluralsight, we're big fans of pizza, Indian and Chinese food.

#### Best practice

With the exception of the serial (Oxford) comma, commas should be used as minimally as possible. Excessive comma use is a barrier to clarity, readability, and a smooth flow.

#### If a sentence contains more than four commas

Too many commas usually means your sentence is too complex and needs to be broken up. Try some reiterations, whether that means breaking the sentence up into multiple sentences, rethinking your syntax, or using alternate punctuation.

### Contractions

#### Could've vs. could of

"Could've" (could have), which refers to something possible that did not occur in the past, and "would've" (would have), which refers to a missed opportunity in the past, are the correct phrases. "Could of" and "would of" are incorrect and should never be used in writing.

#### It's vs. its

"It's" is the contraction of "it is" and should not be confused with "its," a possessive noun.

##### Examples

- It's pretty cool to offer employees four recharge weeks a year.
- Pluralsight recently celebrated its 17-year anniversary.

#### They're vs. their

"They're" is a contraction of "they are" and should not be confused with "their," a possessive noun.

##### Examples

- They're going to love what we're doing for Tech Skills Day this year.
- Pluralsight Flow has helped increase the productivity of their DevOps team.

### Ellipses

When using ellipses ( . . . ) in a quote to indicate missing/skipped material, put a space around each period. (Google Docs adds smaller spaces automatically, which works.)

##### Correct

"Pluralsight Flow is a gamechanger . . . our teams have never been more efficient."

##### Incorrect

"Pluralsight Flow is a gamechanger. . .our teams have never been more efficient."

### Em-dashes

We do not put spaces around em-dashes. See the sentence in "Exclamation points" below for an example.

### Exclamation points

Avoid over-using these. Exclamation points are like high-fives: A well-timed one is great, but too many can be annoying. Use them sparingly&mdash;;they get obnoxious fast. Never use more than one at a time (e.g., like this!!!)

### Hyphen and dash rules

Hyphenate compound modifiers (two or more words that act as a single adjective modifying a single noun—welcome to grammar school!) preceding nouns. Do not hyphenate compound modifiers where the first word is an adverb (ends in -ly).

##### Correct

- The demo-heavy exam took a lot of studying.

##### Incorrect

- The demo heavy exam took a lot of studying. (Why was the exam so heavy? Was it carved in stone?)

#### Other instances of hyphenating

- When not hyphenating would change the meaning of a word (i.e. re-press vs. repress)
- When Merriam-Webster hyphenates words (i.e. T-shirt, anti-establishment)
- In some versions of ages (see more on that below)

#### Common words we use that are always hyphenated

- Long-term
- Short-term
- Full-time
- Industry-leading
- Long-awaited
- Numbers that are spelled out at the start of a sentence (e.g., "Twenty-five pickleball courts seems like a lot.")

Be careful with hyphenated terms that stick together, but that may not need a hyphen. What does this mean? Here's an example:

In the example "On-demand webinar," "on-demand" is a compound modifier with both words adding to the meaning of "webinar."

However, in the example "You can watch the webinar on demand later," "on demand" isn't functioning as a compound modifier and therefore isn't hyphenated. The same goes for another common example: "real-time" and "real time."

### Dashes

An em-dash (&mdash;, `&mdash;`) denotes a break in a sentence or sets off parenthetical statements.

- Use them sparingly&mdash;;they get obnoxious fast.

An en-dash (&ndash;, `&ndash;`) indicates spans or differentiation, where it may be considered to replace “and” or “to.”

- 1&ndash;9

A hyphen (-) joins words and separates syllables of a single word.

- on-demand, twenty-five

A minus symbol (&minus;, `&minus;`) should be used when expressing math operations.

- 4 &minus; 2 = 2

### Punctuation placement and parentheses/quotes

Punctuation falls inside the parentheses if the text is a complete sentence. It falls outside if it's not. Always use double "curly" quotation marks (straight quotation marks indicate measurements of feet and inches) around words or phrases and in dialogue.

##### Correct

- Microsoft is great. (It's sort of great, anyway.)
- Microsoft is great (kind of).
- Paul Allen said, "Microsoft is great!"

##### Incorrect

- Microsoft is great (it's sort of great, anyway).
- Microsoft is great. (kind of)
- Paul Allen said, 'Microsoft is great!'

For quotes, the punctuation almost always falls within the quote. For quotation marks that aren't surrounding a direct quote, only commas and periods fall inside the ending punctuation mark.

##### Example

- Beware of so-called grammar "experts."
- What did you mean by "sort of"?

## Lists

A complete sentence must precede a colon before a bullet list.

##### Example

Meet the cool guys of the forest:

- Bears
- Beavers
- Birds

Use number lists when the order is important, like when you're describing steps of a process. Use bullets when the list's order doesn't matter.

When the list items are not complete sentences, don't use end punctuation, but do capitalize the first word of each item.

## Capitalization

We capitalize using sentence case, which means that even headlines, titles, CTAs, swag, etc., have only the first word capitalized. (See also Headlines)

#### Correct

- Save now
- Level up. Skill up.

##### Incorrect

- Save Now
- Level Up. Skill Up.

Exception: Pluralsight Skills course titles, some Pluralsight Skills features, Pluralsight Flow reports, and some select pieces of content. See Pluralsight-specific rules below for examples.

### Capitalizing after colon

If a complete sentence follows a colon, the first word is always capitalized. If the phrase following a colon isn't complete, the first word is not capitalized.

##### Example

- Utah has two seasons: winter and construction.
- We have one thing to say about working at Pluralsight: You're gonna love it.

### Capitalizing the word "certification"

Certification is capitalized only within a credential if it's part of the official title but not if it follows the official name.

##### Correct

- CompTIA A+ certification

##### Incorrect

- CompTIA A+ Certification

### Headlines

Write headlines in sentence case&mdash;only capitalize the first word and any proper nouns. Only punctuate a headline when it uses more than one sentence, or if it's a question.

##### Correct

- Measure your skills. Learn something new.

##### Incorrect

- Measure your skills.

## Certifications credentials

Contrary to our policy of spelling out a phrase first before using an acronym, we sometimes use acronyms for certification credentials at first mention, unless we deem that the context warrants a further explanation. Contrary to AP Style, we will not place periods after each letter in a certification acronym.

When listing more than one credential, we will include them in parentheses. When listing only one, we use a comma.

##### Example

- Peter Bruzesse, Exchange MVP, will host a webinar on double-hop migrations.
- Peter Bruzesse (Microsoft Exchange MVP, Triple-MCSE, MCT, MCITP) will host a webinar on double-hop migrations.

## Country names

If a country is commonly referred to by an acronym/abbreviation, it's fine to use that acronym on first mention. We do not put periods in between the letters of these acronyms. While not a requirement, for clarity's sake, there's also nothing wrong with spelling out the nation on first mention.

- This is a US promotion.
- Rewards are paid in US dollars.

## Currency

Use the currency symbol before numbers.

- Get $40 off!

When referring to currencies that use the same symbol, include the appropriate national initials. However, do not include those initials in headers:

- USD$40
- AUD$100
- S$30

## Dates

Do not use ordinals (1st, 2nd, 4th) within a sentence.

##### Correct

- On May 15, Microsoft announced

##### Incorrect

- On May 15th, Microsoft. . .

### Decades/year abbreviations

When abbreviated a year or decade, the apostrophe comes before the numbers because it's replacing missing text. When referring to decades more than 100 years ago, be more specific

##### Correct

- '90s
- The 1890s

##### Incorrect

- 90's

## File extensions

When referring to a file extension type, use all uppercase without a period. Add a lowercase "s" to make it plural.

- GIF\*
- PDF
- HTML
- JPGs

\*Pronounced "gif" with a hard "g," not "jif" like the classic peanut butter. Obviously.

When referring to a specific file, the filename should be lowercase:

- gif
- pdf
- Ben-twitter-profile.jpg
- html

## Job titles

A job title should be capitalized only when it immediately precedes a name or if it's following a name and doesn't include "the." When it follows the name and includes "the" or is mentioned without the name, titles are lowercase.

##### Correct

- "According to Pluralsight CEO Aaron Skonnard, . . ."
- "According to Aaron Skonnard, CEO, . . ."
- "According to Lindsay Bayuk, the chief marketing officer of Pluralsight, . . ."
- "According to Lindsay Bayuk, Chief Marketing Officer, . . ."

##### Incorrect

- "According to Pluralsight chief executive officer Aaron Skonnard, . . ."
- "According to the President of the technology learning platform, . . ."
- "According to Lindsay Bayuk, the Chief Marketing Officer of Pluralsight, . . ."

## Names

When first introducing a person, use their full name. Every instance after, refer to the person by first name only. (Note: This is intentionally in conflict with AP to be less formal.)

##### Correct

- Aaron Skonnard is the CEO of Pluralsight.
- "I love technology skill development," said Aaron.

Exception: We do use last names if two people in the piece have the same first name.

##### Example

Chris Glick and Chris Hawk live in Oklahoma City. Glick and Hawk visited Utah. They tried fry sauce and decided to move here.

## Numbers

1&ndash;9 are spelled out; anything higher is in numeric form. Numbers over three digits get commas:

- 999
- 1,000
- 150,000

Write out numbers in full in charts and graphs. Abbreviate them only if there are space restraints (1K, 150K). Within body copy, spell out larger numbers ($12 million, not $12M).

Exceptions: Numbers are always numeric in headlines and in:

- **Ranges** : "It took 4&ndash;5 weeks to study for the exam."
- **Ages** : "The guy who received his VCP was 25 years old."
  - Note: Use a hyphen before a noun, e.g., "A 25-year-old received his VCP."
- **Percentages** : "Onboarding time dropped by 43%."
  - Note: We use the percent symbol (%) in both body copy and headlines

## Plurals for titles

Never include "'s" to indicate the plural of a title.

##### Correct

- MVPs
- MCSEs

##### Incorrect

- MVP's
- MCSE's

## Point of view

Write in second person, meaning address the audience as "you," "your," etc. We talk to our audience directly, addressing them as "you," not as "one," "persons," etc. (We want to avoid phrases like this: "To take a skill assessment, one needs to select. . .") This language feels formal and unnatural. However, we'll sometimes use third-person POV to refer to specific audiences ("Pluralsight Skills helps technologists. . .").

We also want to show our audience that we're in this together by using the first-person "we" when we can.

## Spacing

We use only one space between sentences.

## Telephone numbers

Use periods without spaces between numbers. Omit the +1. Use a country code only if your reader is in another country.

##### Correct

- 867.5309

##### Incorrect

- +1-404-123-4567

## Time series/formatting

When listing time, follow AP conventions, listing a.m. or p.m. on only one of the times unless the time spans a.m. and p.m. Also, it's a.m. and p.m., not AM and PM. Drop :00 from any times that start at the hour. Use noon or midnight instead of 12 a.m. and 12 p.m. Use an en-dash, not a hyphen, to separate the times, with spaces on both sides of the en-dash.

(Hint: You don't have to track down and insert an en-dash. The shortcut on Macs is Option + Hyphen key and on Windows is Control + 0150.)

##### Correct

- 10:30 a.m. &ndash; 1 p.m.
- Noon &ndash; 3 p.m.
- 1 &ndash; 5:30 p.m.

##### Incorrect

- 9:00 am-11:00 am
- 2-4 PM
- 8 p.m.-12 a.m.

Abbreviate time zones within the continental United States as follows (no comma before time zone):

- **Eastern time:** ET
- **Central time:** CT
- **Mountain time:** MT
- **Pacific time:** PT

## Who vs. that

We always use "who" to refer to people, never "that." It's people who work in IT, not people that work in IT.

## Writing about companies

Companies are "they" when in the context of referring to the company as a group of people, or referring to the actions of people at the company, but are "it" when referring to the company as an entity where the people are less relevant.

##### Correct

- Citrix structures their certifications to the specific product/solution that is being targeted. For example, their offerings include XenDesktop 5 and XenApp 6.
- Note: "Citrix" the entity did not structure its certifications a certain way, the people at the company strategically built this structure a certain way.

##### Incorrect

- Citrix structures its certifications to the specific product/solution that is being targeted. For example, its offerings include XenDesktop 5 and XenApp 6.

Use a company's website as the source of truth on capitalization, spelling, and other branding.
