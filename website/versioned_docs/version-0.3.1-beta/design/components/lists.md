## Description

A set of related text-only content.

## Anatomy/Structure

- List-group
  - List item
    - Bullet
    - Content
- List-group (definition lists)
  - List item
    - Definition term
    - Definitions
      - Definition description(s)

## Usage

### Types

- **Unordered** (bulleted or non-bulleted)
  - Used to list items that are not numerically ordered or ranked
- **Ordered** (numbered)
  - Used to list items when an inherent order, priority, or sequence needs to be communicated
- **Definition** (term and description pairs)
  - Used to list key/value and term/definition types of information.

### Best practices and use

- Definition list terms can have multiple definitions, also displayed vertically in a list view.
- Definition list descriptions can be aligned to the leading or trailing edge of the descriptions column.
- Unordered and ordered lists can be nested, but should be limited to one nested level.
- Unordered list bullets (when displayed) will size according to the list content font-size. Bullets will be approximately 50% of the font-size value (though this may vary by browser and/or platform, as this is using the native browser bullet sizing).

### Dos and don'ts

- Do not use definition lists for the display of multiple columns and rows of data. Instead, use a Table.
- Do use Definition lists when only rows of terms/descriptions or keys/values should be displayed, when no further columns are needed.
- Do not exceed 2 levels of nesting (the initial list items, and 1 nested list level)
- Do not nest definition lists.

## Content Guidance

### Microcopy

- Use sentence case for all list items. Exceptions include acronyms or applicable product names.
- Complete sentences should use proper punctuation.

### Content considerations

- List items should be phrased consistently if possible, starting each phrase with a noun or verb as applicable.
