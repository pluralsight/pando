Whether you are a designer or developer, Pando has been designed from the start
for gradual adoption. You can use as little or as much Pando as you need. No
matter if you are looking to try out Pando, add some new functionality to an
HTML page, or start a complex Pando-powered app, this section will help you get
started.

## Try Pando

You don't need to install anything to play with Pando. Try editing this live sandbox!

```jsx live
function HelloWorld() {
  return (
    <div>
      <div>
        <h2>Hello World!</h2>
        <p>Pando uses plain JSX for both components and typography styling!</p>
      </div>

      <button {...getButtonProps().button}>Action</button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

:::tip

You can edit the code directly and see instant results. Most of the developer examples in this site contain sandboxes like this.
